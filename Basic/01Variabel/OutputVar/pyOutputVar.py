"""
Output Variables
The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
"""
x = "Python is Awesome"
print(x)

# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
x = "python"
y = "called"
z = "programming language"
print(x,y,z)

# You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:

a = "Python"
b = "Adalah salah satu"
c = "Bahasa Pemrograman"
print(a+ b+ c)

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
x = 9
y = 8
print(x + y)

# In the print() function, when you try to combine
# a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:

x = "John"
y = 90
print(x , y)
