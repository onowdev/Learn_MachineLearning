There are three numeric types in Python:

1. int >> Int or integer, is a whole number, 
positive or negative, without decimals, 
of unlimited length.

2. float >> Float or "floating point number" 
is a number, positive or negative, containing 
one or more decimals.

3. complex >> Complex
Complex numbers are written 
with a "j" as the imaginary part:

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
